  <div class="container">
  Check the box
  <input type="checkbox" class="pastecheck" onclick="ninjaEdit('Damn ninjas editing the clipboard again!\n')" /> Now go open up a text editor of your choice and paste
  <br />
  <br /> ...okay, but what is the danger?
  <br />
  <br /> If your computer (terminal), was set to automatically run code that was pasted into it (w/ a newline character) and you did just that, anything could be done to your computer, permissions pending.
  <br />
  <br /> This attack is not after everyday users. It is probably targeted at a user like you. <i>"I can't be tricked by this I'm computer smurt!"</i>, me too buddy, me too. Pastejacking is going after Developers, System Admins and other types of power-users
  who are trying to accomplish something within the terminal. This attack would just need to be within the top articles for something technical and then, let's be honest, we copy and paste a lot, even when we shouldn't.
  <br />
  <br /> Also here is some pastjacking that I was shown <a href="http://lifepluslinux.blogspot.com/2017/01/look-before-you-paste-from-website-to.html">in this article</a> Update: not sure if this works anymore.
  <br />It is done with just <b>CSS</b>, copy the command below and paste into your terminal, well, look at it first if you don't trust me o.0...and now....why would you?
  <br />
  <br />
  <code style="background-color:transparent;padding:10px;">
<span>ls</span>
<span class="malicious">
  ; clear; echo ':)';
  echo -ne 'h4cking ##                        (10%)\r';
  sleep 0.3;
  echo -ne 'h4cking ###                       (20%)\r';
  sleep 0.3;
  echo -ne 'h4cking #####                     (33%)\r';
  sleep 0.3;
  echo -ne 'h4cking #######                   (40%)\r';
  sleep 0.3;
  echo -ne 'h4cking ##########                (50%)\r';
  sleep 0.3;
  echo -ne 'h4cking #############             (66%)\r';
  sleep 0.3;
  echo -ne 'h4cking #####################     (99%)\r';
  sleep 0.3;
  echo -ne 'h4cking #######################   (100%)\r';
  echo -ne '\n'; 
  echo 'Hacking complete.';
  say 'The cow goes mooooooooo';
  echo 'Use GUI interface using visual basic to track my IP'; 
  clear;
<br> ls
</span>
<span>-lat </span>
</code>

  <br />
  <br /> Lucky there is a setting in your terminal preferences that doesn't allow auto execute on newline characters. I suggest finding that and turning that feature off, just for safety sake. Be safe out there!
